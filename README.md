We got 1460 sale prices with a mean of roughly 181K and a median of 163K. It is positively skewed. The maximum value is 755K and the minimum value is 35K. With a Ïƒ of 79K the values are fairly volatile. Lower and upper percentile are 130K and 755K respectively.

### Imputation
There's effectively only one missing value in the Electrical column, the rest can be relabeled according to the documentation. I chose to fill the one missing value with the mode of the column, i. e. `SBrkr` (Standard Circuit Breakers & Romex).
