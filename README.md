# House-prices-prediction

## 01 Initial motivation
Having recently started working in proptech, I want to get a thorough understanding of the real estate market. I seek to explore options on how machine learning and data analytics may be of use in developing automated and reliable solutions for classical real estate problems. As a first step, I planned to build a model to predict house prices. Armed with the Ames Housing dataset I set myself to work ...

## 02 EDA
Understanding the dataset and its peculiarities is key when trying to come up with a robust model, so let's start with the explorative data analysis.

### Features
#### Dependent variable: SalePrice
![Alt text](plots/SalePrice_histplot.png?raw=true "Histplot for dependent variable ('SalePrice')")

We got 1460 datapoints, with a mean of roughly 181K and a median of 163K. It is positively skewed. The maximum value is 755K and the minimum value is 35K. With a Ïƒ of 79K the values are fairly volatile. Lower and upper percentile are 130K and 755K respectively.

### Imputation
There's effectively only one missing value in the Electrical column, the rest can be relabeled according to the documentation. I chose to fill the one missing value with the mode of the column, i. e. `SBrkr` (Standard Circuit Breakers & Romex).

### Correlations

The features that correlate most with SalePrice are:
1. OverallQual - 0.79 (Rates the overall material and finish of the house)
2. GrLivArea - 0.71 (Above ground living area in square feet)
3. GarageCars - 0.64 (Size of garage in car capacity)
4. GarageArea - 0.62 (Size of garage in square feet)
5. TotalBsmtSF - 0.61 (Total square feet of basement area)
6. 1stFlrSF - 0.61 (First Floor square feet)
7. FullBath - 0.56 (Full bathrooms above grade)
8. TotRmsAbvGrd - 0.53 (Total rooms above grade)
9. YearBuilt - 0.52 (Original construction date)
10. YearRemodAdd - 0.51 (Remodel date)
